## 4.1

wanna math proof, i have searched a lot of solution including NOCOW, however all of them only proof the situation when gcd(a,b)=1, the max unacceptable is ab-a-b

as a counter-example `gcd(2*3,3*5,5*2)=1`, or even more number and all of them gcd equals 1, so I can't understand why the maxnum is less than 256, for my mathematical ability is too poor to understand??

And assume that they want to use the above conclusion, it should to find the minimum value instead of maximum, although i haven't find a counter-example, these two are obviously not the same math problem, how can they misusing it.

below are two links related to this problem, also none of them has own a good proved solution.

at last, my code use a proved solution ,  if `minvalue` of continuity number is avaliable, then the max unacceptable is less than these number .  and gcd(all)=1 has solution ,gcd(all)!=1 has no solution

wow! the official answer is as same as mine, it also mention the method with gcd, also has no proof for gcd to any
